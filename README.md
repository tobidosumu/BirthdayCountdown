3. * What are UUIDs?   

      Answer:  
      UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier, which is a   
      string of characters that is guaranteed to be unique across   
      all systems and devices.  
      
   * Why UUIDs?    
  
      Answer:  
      UUIDs are used to uniquely identify entities such as database   
      records, files, or anything else that needs to be uniquely   
      identified in a decentralized system.  
      
   * How UUIDs?  
   
      Answer:  
      UUIDs can be generated using libraries or built-in functions in   
      programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, etc. They usually   
      follow a specific format, such as the standard format defined by   
      the ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005.  
      
   * WhenÂ UUIDs?  
   
      Answer:
      UUIDs are used whenever a unique identifier is required for an entity,  
      such as when generating session IDs for web sessions, or when assigning  
      unique IDs to records in a database.
